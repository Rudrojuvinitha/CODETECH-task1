Overview of the project:

Project:PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER
Output:https://github.com/Rudrojuvinitha/CODETECH-task1

objective:Deveolp a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users.Implement algorithms to analyze factors such as length,complexity, and uniqueness to provide feedback on password strength

keyactivites:A password strength checker is a tool used in cybersecurity to evaluate the strength of a password and provide feedback on its security. Here's a breakdown of what a password strength checker typically assesses:

1. Length: Longer passwords are generally stronger. A minimum of 12 characters is recommended.

2. Complexity: A mix of character types, such as:
    - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
    - Lowercase letters (a-z)
    - Numbers (0-9)
    - Special characters (!, @, #, etc.)

3. Uniqueness: Avoid using easily guessable information, like:
    - Names
    - Birthdates
    - Common words
    - Sequences (e.g., "123456" or "qwerty")

4. Similarity: Avoid using similar passwords or variations of previously used passwords.

A password strength checker may use a scoring system or provide feedback on the password's strength, often categorizing it as:
* Weak
* Medium
* Strong
* Very Strong

Some checkers may also provide suggestions to improve the password's strength.

Keep in mind that even strong passwords can be compromised if not managed properly. It's essential to use unique passwords for each account, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and regularly update passwords.
